Boost v1.53 static library binaries for Android.

Built with Android NDK r8d, using gcc toolchain, gnu libstdc++ v4.6, -std=c++11

I use these to build Cinder for Android. These binaries are provided as-is.
They are minimally tested, and are known to have problems when linked against
objects built with other toolchains (i.e. Clang) / STL versions.
